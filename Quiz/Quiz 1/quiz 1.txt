Why it is never a good idea to store any data in the
segment registers?
The main use of segment register is  It provides a powerful memory management mechanism.
It allows to processes to easily share data
the segment registers which is combined of four segments mainly deal with the addresses of the data .
but not with the storing of data .
we can load data on segment register but it is not ideal to store data on segment register .

2. Explain GPR in terms of storing data.
GPR or General Purpose register is used to store temporary data in the microprocessor .In every microprocessor there is atleast 8 GPR to store temporaray data .
